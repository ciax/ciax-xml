========================== Issue =============================
***DEBUG
crt: doesn't work(11/2)
dso: doesn't work(11/2)
dso:fix jack bolt stack after interrupt(8/15)
aso:need reset function for executing flag
cart:attach at tag11 gives overload error by corn load unbalance [4/17]
  -> Reduce Lv1 height of each jack that will be 27mm at #3 Jack. [6/9]
cart:doesn't work on test run with appsh(11/2)
cart:need clear tag command for reset manually on app mode

***REQUEST
mcr-old:interlock error log
mcr-old:remove door open interlock(11/2)

***UPDATE
mcr: macro log
wdb: watch status log
crt: jack table edit interface (sql+web)

***UPGRADE
sql: using sqlite for symboling, labeling as cache

***CHECK NEED
verify on motion: adb-oss
watch: multicondition
verify: oss jack num corresponding
crt: actual motion

========================== Result =============================
***SOLVED
debug:error "no such command 'exe'" in dsi
station:OPT side = charging can be on under auto mode
        IR side = carging will be off under auto mode 
        --> Fixed, for no special reason. [4/17-4/21]
dso:bolt stat is N/A with cramp -> macro interlock 
         status corrected by farther push button [4/17-4/21]
debug:VER=all getilk dsi fhook - makes Socket error [4/21]
      refered dzi status in idb; connect to dzi makes error
XML to DB: using libfrmdb, libclsdb[5/9]
  ruby bug: segmentation fault inside of xmllib2 -> xml process description moves to hash at initialize
    -> Purge xml access from operational method(getstat)
    --> Purge xml access from adb stat [4/10]
    --> Purge xml access from fdb stat [4/20]
labeling: use the lib*cmd.rb -> use lib*db.rb
symboling: symbol reference will move to status/value@symbol
symboling&labeling: should be commutative
interrupt: interrupt handling (add new error class)[5/23]
grouping: sort function, move circular from libappprt[5/31]
mcr: cart run1 at tag 9 with comics gives error with "No such key 'n'" [4/17]
    -> mcr converted %r to n/a came from "ion"
   --> ion symbol changed (0=OFF f=ON DEF=N/A -> DEF=ON) [4/21] 
   ---> change both crt and dct (was crt only) [6/9]
more variation:fdb//values/int@decode (sined/unsined, hexstr16,...) [6/13]
libdb: chache function[8/15]
mcr:dsi,dso/ exe finish immediately after command issue [4/17,6/9,6/19]
crt:clssh crt gives error
dts:status update works but appears incorrect status [4/17]
dbchache: make it module -> independent class[9/1]
objdb: using objdb to get iocmd instead of DB-object[9/1]
status_??: update with clsobj -> save in cmd_thread of AppSv[9/1]
client,hprelay:using http for display status[9/8]
hprelay: exe should be reset[9/6]
Client: use socket instead of IoCmd(11/3)
exadbc:need to verify frame commands(11/3)
wdb: show watch status in shell(11/3)
shell: toggle status display mode(view,stat,watch)(11/3)
using sqlite for logging stat

***DISCARD
field data initialize: give up/response needs param for array range (mel/get_tbl), need to get possible param from command domain
