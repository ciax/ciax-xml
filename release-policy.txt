master  : stable version (having good track record, back up for the actual operation)
testing : in normal operation
beta    : stable in adding new feature (works)
develop : unstable in adding new feature (no work)

release order:
 develop -> beta -> testing -> master

In operation:
 Usually, use testing version at first time in every operation.
 If something wrong is found, get back to master version.
 If it goes well on several time operation, version will be shifted.
 (testing -> master, beta -> testing, develop -> beta)

Debug:
 Debug will be done at operating version (usually testing).
 Then it is merged into beta -> develop.
