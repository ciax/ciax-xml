========================== Result =============================
***DISCARD
field data initialize: give up/response needs param for array range (mel/get_tbl), need to get possible param from command domain
aso:need reset function for executing flag
sql: using sqlite for symboling, labeling as cache
app: watch layer will be separated as "Event" including interlock and skip

***SOLVED
debug:error "no such command 'exe'" in dsi
station:OPT side = charging can be on under auto mode
        IR side = carging will be off under auto mode
        --> Fixed, for no special reason. [4/17-4/21]
dso:bolt stat is N/A with cramp -> macro interlock
         status corrected by farther push button [4/17-4/21]
debug:VER=all getilk dsi fhook - makes Socket error [4/21]
      refered dzi status in idb; connect to dzi makes error
XML to DB: using libfrmdb, libclsdb[5/9]
  ruby bug: segmentation fault inside of xmllib2 -> xml process description moves to hash at initialize
    -> Purge xml access from operational method(getstat)
    --> Purge xml access from adb stat [4/10]
    --> Purge xml access from fdb stat [4/20]
labeling: use the lib*cmd.rb -> use lib*db.rb
symboling: symbol reference will move to status/value@symbol
symboling&labeling: should be commutative
interrupt: interrupt handling (add new error class)[5/23]
grouping: sort function, move circular from libinssh[5/31]
mcr: cart run1 at tag 9 with comics gives error with "No such key 'n'" [4/17]
    -> mcr converted %r to n/a came from "ion"
   --> ion symbol changed (0=OFF f=ON DEF=N/A -> DEF=ON) [4/21]
   ---> change both crt and dct (was crt only) [6/9]
more variation:fdb//values/int@decode (sined/unsined, hexstr16,...) [6/13]
libdb: chache function[8/15]
mcr:dsi,dso/ exe finish immediately after command issue [4/17,6/9,6/19]
crt:clssh crt gives error
dts:status update works but appears incorrect status [4/17]
dbchache: make it module -> independent class[9/1]
objdb: using objdb to get iocmd instead of DB-object[9/1]
status_??: update with clsobj -> save in cmd_thread of App::Sv[9/1]
client,hprelay:using http for display status[9/8]
hprelay: exe should be reset[9/6]
Client: use socket instead of IoCmd(11/3)
exadbc:need to verify frame commands(11/3)
wdb: show watch status in shell(11/3)
shell: toggle status display mode(view,stat,watch)(11/3)
using sqlite for logging stat
wdb: watch status log[12/7]
rdb field log(fieldlog.sq3)[12/12]
hexpack:crt:status is not correct 12/14
cart:doesn't work on test run with appsh(11/2)
cart:need clear tag command for reset manually on app mode
command log (app level) 12/14
crt: actual motion
watch: multicondition
inthex: update upper level status even if frame level(applevel) is manipulated(12/19)
hexpack:crt:no exe stat just after command issued 12/14-(12/10 checked)
frame log format(add version, data->base64)
crt: tag_table readout(12/1/6) fixed by watanabe[1/20]
crt/hexint:reset doesn't work(1/23/12) [1/26]
dso/hexint:reset doesn't work(1/31)[2/3]
dso/hexint:return immediately after pnumatic command isued (1/31)[2/8]
frmcl,appcl: client should accept internal commands
 xx -> validate internal commands in Frm::Sh or App::Sh
 -> no validation in client [2/9/12]
cart:attach at tag11 gives overload error by corn load unbalance [4/17]
  -> Reduce Lv1 height of each jack that will be 27mm at #3 Jack. [6/9]
  -> Lv1 height is set that is little bit higher than grounding[12/1/?]
crt: not clear command trigger after running command issued(12/1/6)
crt:too short timeout for cart unnint (tag11-3) 1->12 OK
AppPrt: make @view with item,label,caption etc. -> data name is pending
Shell,Server: will become module and every int object will have this feature[4/14]
prompt: will be object
hexint: will be module
field,stat: format standardize(4/26/12)
update:add ext_???() method including add new method instead of extend(Module)
intapp,intfrm/ set command should work at test (-t) mode
more intelligent chache system with detecting file update like as Makefile
Command: should includes procs
libfrmconv takes raw data -> Stream w/o IO (data+date) (2/15/13)
Var::Val -> Var+module Upd(2/27/13)
hexpack: too short return on exec (12/9/27)
crt/hexint:return after command issued  without exe flag(12/1/6)
bug: appsh -cf(4/8/13)
server(???d) migrate to appsv
client doesn't send any command (blank command was assinged to item)(12/12/19) -> send JSON
crt:cart charging status is '4'(12/2/16) - hexpack bug
dts:need more time to detect motion after moving command issue(12/3/12)
mcr: batch mode w/showing progress
list: applist,frmlit-> share db -> inslist
crt:get_tbl doesn't work 13/6/12
client status doesn't update (inssh -ec) 13/6/12
var: module upd gets into Var
var: rename Var to Data with new name space
all: set entire name space (CIAX?)
watch: no command issued by auto(reset at dsi command end) (12/9/27) [13/7/22]
macro: interrupt doesn't finish macro.(13/11/14) : Done 13/11/15
macro: second macro issued -> INVALID(13/11/14) : Done 13/11/15
inssh: can't save 12/10/14 : Done 12/10/14
